    # Sample configuration file for retrogame.
    # Really minimal syntax, typically two elements per line w/space delimiter:
    # 1) a key name (from keyTable.h; shortened from /usr/include/linux/input.h).
    # 2) a GPIO pin number; when grounded, will simulate corresponding keypress.
    # Uses Broadcom pin numbers for GPIO.
    # If first element is GND, the corresponding pin (or pins, multiple can be
    # given) is a LOW-level output; an extra ground pin for connecting buttons.
    # A '#' character indicates a comment to end-of-line.
    # File can be edited "live," no need to restart retrogame!
     
    # Here's a pin configuration for the Pi-Cade project:
     
    LEFT      27  # Joypad left
    RIGHT     22  # Joypad right
    UP        10  # Joypad up
    DOWN       9  # Joypad down
    LEFTCTRL  26  # 'A' button
    LEFTALT   11  # 'B' button
    Z         24  # 'X' button
    X         16  # 'Y' button
    SPACE      5  # 'Select' button
    ENTER      6  # 'Start' button
    PAGEDOWN  18  # Left Shoulder Button
    PAGEUP    17  # Right Shoulder Button
     
    # For configurations with few buttons (e.g. Cupcade), a key can be followed
    # by multiple pin numbers.  When those pins are all held for a few seconds,
    # this will generate the corresponding keypress (e.g. ESC to exit ROM).
    # Only ONE such combo is supported within the file though; later entries
    # will override earlier.
